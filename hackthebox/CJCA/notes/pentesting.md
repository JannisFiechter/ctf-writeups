# Notes Pentesting
## Pentesting Process 
- Pre-Engagement: In this phase, everything necessary for the actual penetration test is discussed, developed, defined, and documented in writing. Here we obtain the necessary permissions and rights to execute hacking attacks on predetermined systems and simulate a real cyber attack.

- Information Gathering: In this phase, we collect as much information as possible about the target company to understand exactly how it is structured, how it functions, what it depends on, and what technical resources it requires.

- Vulnerability Assessment: After collecting as much information as possible, this must be carefully analyzed and correlated to identify potential attack vectors that could lead to a successful attack.

- Exploitation: Here, the identified attack vectors are targeted and defense mechanisms are bypassed.

- ost-Exploitation: Once we have gained access to a target system to control it from the inside and gathered enough internal information, we attempt to escalate privileges to the highest possible level.

- Lateral Movement: This phase occurs when we use the compromised system to move through the internal network.

- Proof-of-Concept: From all our notes, screenshots, and documentation, a report is created with the individual steps to reproduce our actions for successfully identifying each vulnerability.

- Post-Engagement: This is the phase where we show the report to the client and discuss it together, answer questions, and help them close the vulnerabilities found.

## Defining the Scope of Work
- Goals: What the company wants to achieve - in our case: cyber security assessment confirming their systems are secure
- Limits: What will and won't be tested - only the 2 provided hosts (Web application on Linux and the Windows host)
- Methods: How the testing will be done - Black box, without prior knowledge of the web application, the Linux host nor the Windows host
- Schedule: When things will happen - for us: take your time as much as you need
- Our Role: Assisting our penetration testing team during their engagement
- Results: What reports and recommendations will be provided - we are tasked to provide our findings to the team lead

## Agreement & Preparation
### Legal
- A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA): This is a legal document that requires the testing team to keep all sensitive information private. It protects both the organization's data and the details of any security weaknesses found during testing.

- Permission to test: This is a formal document that gives the testing team legal permission to do their work. Without it, their activities might look like illegal hacking. Usually, this comes as a signed authorization letter.

- Contact information: The agreement lists everyone involved in the test and their roles. This includes the main contact person at the organization, the testing team, and emergency contacts. Having clear communication channels helps deal with any issues quickly.

### Scope & Rules
- A scoping questionnaire and document: These explain exactly what will be tested. The questionnaire asks about the organization's systems and goals, while the document lists which networks and applications will be tested and which ones won't be.

- Rules of engagement (ROE): This document explains how the testing will be done. It covers things like when testing can happen, what methods can be used, and what to do if something goes wrong. For example, it might say whether testers can try to trick employees (social engineering) or if they should avoid testing during busy hours.

### Contract
- Timeline: This part shows when each phase of the test will happen, from start to finish. It includes time for preparing, testing, and writing reports. It also adds extra time for unexpected issues.

- Responsibilities: This section outlines who is responsible for what (client & testers) during the test. It includes who will oversee the testing, who needs to be available during critical testing phases, who handles emergencies, and who is responsible for reviewing and acting on the findings.

- Deliverables: These are the final products that will be provided to the organization after testing. This typically includes detailed reports of findings, technical documentation, and recommendations for improvements. The agreement should specify the format, level of detail, and timeline for delivering these materials.

### Example
# 0. Summary

### FTP
- Access and Environment
- Anonymous FTP access was enabled on port 21
- We identified this as a home directory for user john
- Several important configuration and history files were accessible

### Critical Files
- .bash_history file revealed potential credentials: john:SuperSecurePass123
- SSH private key (id_rsa) was obtained and is not password protected
- WordPress setup documentation revealed temporary FTP configuration

### Security Implications
- Exposed SSH private key could allow unauthorized system access
- FTP server was intended to be temporary but remained accessible
- Internal documentation exposed system configuration details
- Command history revealed sensitive operations and potential credentials

### WordPress
- Running WordPress version 6.7.2 (Latest version)
- Server: Apache/2.4.52 (Ubuntu)
- XML-RPC enabled and accessible
- Theme: twentytwentyfive v1.0
- Plugin: hash-form v1.1.0 - vulnerable to RCE (CVE-2024-5084)

Attacker@Pwnbox:~$ cat WordPress_Blog_Setup_Update.txt

**Subject: Update on WordPress Blog Setup**

Dear Team,

We are currently in the process of setting up a new blog using WordPress.
To facilitate this setup, we have temporarily configured an FTP server.

Please note:
- This FTP server is for internal use only during the initial setup phase.
- Access credentials are temporary and will be revoked once the blog setup is complete or if security necessitates it.

However, we have recently received a high-priority ticket that requires immediate attention. As a result,
the completion of the blog setup will be slightly delayed. We are committed to addressing this urgent issue first to ensure our services remain uninterrupted.

We will notify the responsible parties as soon as the WordPress blog and web application are fully operational.
We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work to prioritize our tasks effectively.

Thank you for your cooperation.

Best Regards,
John Doe
Development Team
